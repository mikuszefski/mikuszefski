- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikuszefski
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and fitting. As a physicist I am especially concerned about errors. 
    Originally, I was working with Wolfram's Mathematica. After having about 20 years of experience,
    starting with version 1 and calling version 2 my first own, I changed to Python due to license issues.
    Meaning, my employers didn't have one.
- 🌱 I’m still learning Python, i.e. I am trying to improve my skills continuously.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...  hmmm ... nothing for the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me via mikuszefski aAa gmail.com
